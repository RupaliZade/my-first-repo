    <h2>we are learning Git and Github</h2>
    <p>Git and GitHub are tools for managing and sharing code, but they are distinct. Git is a version control system, a
        software that manages code changes over time, while GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories.
        Think of Git as the tool you use locally on your computer to track changes, and GitHub as the online storage and
        collaboration hub where you can share your code with others.</p>
